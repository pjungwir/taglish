Taglish
=======

Taglish is yet another tagging library for Rails.
It borrows heavily from [acts-as-taggable-on](https://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on), but it has a different feature set, the reflection stuff is refactored for greater comprehension, and it aims to remove [acts-as-taggable-on's memory leaks](https://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on/issues/94).
It major new feature is support for "scored" tags, so a model can have tags like `ruby:9, sql:5, js:4`.

It is still in heavy development, so lots of things are changing and I don't make any promises.
